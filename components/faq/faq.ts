               `Regarding the leasing of devices, we offer the option to lease the necessary 
               devices for connectivity, namely the Radio and Access points. This approach is 
               intended to make the overall installation cost more affordable. The monthly 
               installment payment for the leased devices is set at 5,000. This amount will 
               continue until you have fully paid off the device, with the total cost remaining the 
               same. Alternatively, if you prefer, you have the option to make an outright 
               payment.  
                
               It is important to note that before proceeding with the lease plan, you will be 
               required to sign an agreement document.

               `Begin by checking the power status of your access point. If it is powered on, 
               proceed to examine the number of lights illuminated on the access point. 
               
               Ideally, you should observe three green lights. 
               If this is not the case, verify your cable connections. 
               However, if you do see three green lights, please contact our customer care line for further assistance. `
